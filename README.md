## Prompt:

### Final Project: Data Visualization for Data Science
#### Overview
Working with your team, you are to design a dashboard visualization for the Mayor of South Bend. It should interact with one or more of the data sets in a way that provides insights into the data and inform decisions the Mayor must make.  

#### Background
The Mayor would like to understand more about how disparate South Bend civic data sets interact with each other. Your team has been asked to prepare a presentation to the Mayor for the purposes of demonstrating your dashboard.

#### The Data
Below is a list of slightly modified data sets from the City of South Bendâ€™s Open Data Portal. Access these data sets on Github. If you would like to use any other data sets for your final project, please check with your instructor.
 - 311 calls
 - Census data
 - Business licenses
 - Code enforcement Cases
 - City Council districts
 - Public facilities
 - Schools
 - Parks
 - Abandoned properties
 - Locations of street lights
 
#### The Audience
Your team will be presenting your dashboard data visualization to the Mayor using South Bend civic data sets. This could be like the use case we saw in the intro videos, but you are not limited to those data.


#### Final Project Instructions

1. As a team, design and create a dashboard using shinyapp.io that enables interactivity with one or more of the data sets provided.
  a. Each team member must design a separate tab (or NavList entry) on the dashboard that enables a unique interaction or type of visualization.
  b. One team member can choose to handle/coordinate the design choices to make everything consistent/build the architecture.
2. Draft a two-page, double spaced project brief detailing the rationale for your design choices. This should include:
An overview of the goals
  a. A rationale for the dashboard / user interface
  b. An Audience analysis
  c. Present your solution to the client in a 5-10 minute video recorded group presentation.
